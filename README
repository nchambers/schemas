-----------------------------------------
(1) Pre-Process the text.

The java class AllParser handles parsing, dependencies, events, and coreference. 
The run script runallparser.sh can be used.

./runallparser.sh -output <output-directory> -input text <input-directory>

This requires the parser's serialized file: englishPCFG.ser.gz 
AllParser searches a couple paths for that file, including the current directory. You could use a symlink to point to it.

* The "-input text" flag defines the type of input. This version has not been extensively tested. Check TextHandler.java if fixes need to be made. It treats each file as a single document.



-----------------------------------------
(2) Compute Inverse Document Frequencies.

The class CalculateIDF handles word counting and IDF computation.
It inputs a directory or single file of .parse files (created from Step 1), and 
creates two .idf files in a specified output directory. A run script is provided:

./runidf.sh -outdir idfs/ someoutput/

You must create the output directory before running it.

(3) Create the domain's argument counts.
